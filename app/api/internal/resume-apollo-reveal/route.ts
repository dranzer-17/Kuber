/**
 * The only scheduled job in the app that can spend money.
 *
 * It finishes the Apollo email-reveal for imports whose own self-chain died
 * part-way — a redeploy, a crash, or a batch killed by the function time limit.
 * Those leads were never asked about, so the credit it spends is their first,
 * not a repeat.
 *
 * It is a SEPARATE route on a SEPARATE schedule (once a day) precisely because
 * it costs money. It used to ride along inside the 15-minute enrichment
 * watchdog, which meant any defect in the reveal path got 96 chances a day to
 * become a charge — that is how a single unresolvable lead ran up ~420 credits
 * between 15 and 26 July 2026 before anyone noticed. Once a day, the same
 * defect costs 1 credit a day and is obvious in the usage log long before it
 * matters.
 *
 * The delay costs nothing real: a healthy import chains itself through in
 * seconds and never reaches this job at all. This only exists for the case
 * where that chain broke, and a lead that arrives a day later is still a lead.
