 *     -> saved as     Ankit Singh          (never bold again)
 *
 * Unrecoverable, and worse on each pass. The same held for <em>, <u> and links —
 * <a href="...">brochure</a> kept the word and threw the URL away.
 *
 * Two copies of htmlToPlainText existed (generate-drafts and generate-reply),
 * both with the bug. One copy now, so an inverse rule can never be added to one
 * side and forgotten on the other.
