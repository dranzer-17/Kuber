/**
 * Retry schedule per service. Apollo gets NONE — deliberately.
 *
 * Apollo bills a credit the moment a people/bulk_match request is *received*,
 * including requests it then rejects with 429 and requests we abandon on
 * timeout. Proven against the live account on 2026-07-14: 1,403 people were
 * asked for and Apollo charged 3,222 credits — 2.30x — because this helper
 * retried every rate-limited attempt and Apollo billed each one. Retrying a
 * billed endpoint is buying the same record twice.
 *
 * So Apollo gets exactly one attempt per request, ever. A batch that fails is
 * released back to the queue unpenalised (enrich-leads.ts) and resumed by the
 * 15-minute watchdog, which costs nothing. Firecrawl and the LLM providers
 * charge on delivery, not receipt, so retrying those is genuinely free and
 * their schedule is unchanged.
