/**
 * What a provider error MEANS, separated from what to do about it.
 *
 * Two callers ask two different questions of the same error string, with very
 * different costs for getting it wrong, so they get two predicates:
 *
 *   isProviderOutage  — "is this the provider's fault, not the lead's?"
 *                       Decides whether a failed draft counts toward that
 *                       lead's 3-strike retry cap. False positive = one extra
 *                       retry. False negative = a lead permanently stranded.
 *                       So: broad.
 *
 *   isOutOfCredits    — "is the account empty?" Decides whether to take a key
 *                       out of service until a human intervenes. False
 *                       positive = a manager has to click Re-check. So:
 *                       billing-specific wording only.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free, which is what lets scripts/check-provider-errors.ts
 * run it under plain node with no build step.

/** Marker written into email_drafts.rejection_reason when a draft failed

 *  about the lead. fetchDraftTargets and countPendingDrafts skip rows carrying
 *  it, so an outage cannot burn through a lead's three retries.
 *
 *  On 7 Aug 2026 both of the client's keys ran dry mid-campaign (OpenAI 429
 *  insufficient_quota, OpenRouter 402) and 61 consecutive attempts failed in
