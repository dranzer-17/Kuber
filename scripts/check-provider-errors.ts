 * Every string marked LIVE below is a verbatim error recorded in production on
 * 7 Aug 2026, when both LLM keys ran dry mid-campaign. Those are the cases that
 * actually matter: the previous version of isProviderOutage() missed the most
 * common one ("No LLM provider configured"), so 58 of 60 credit failures were
 * charged to the leads and 20 of them were permanently written off.
 *
 * No framework on purpose — provider-errors.ts has zero imports, so plain node
 * runs this with no build step.
